Crashing

Crash2.stm without Spike2 100rpt expts. crahses July 11 2014
seems not when using leantest, but double check this
Crash2.stm just free running trials does not crash for 24 hours.
Crash2 4000 trials per expt: Crashes near end of second lap
Crash2 10000 trials per expt. Crashes after 3831 in first expt
Crash2 leantest when PRESTIM is bypassed and RunExptStim is in testloop. Crashes after 4578 trials

Including different states. Best done by setting state after WAIT_FOR RESPONSE
Crash2 testloop is 1->2  2->3 459->12 12->1  crash after 6500

WAIT_FOR_RESPONSE -> PRESTIM
                459/12-> 459/12 does not crash
WAIT_FOR_RESPONSE -> INTERTRIAL
		 1/1 1/2 2/3 459/12  Does crash, but only after 38854 stims
WAIT_FOR_RESPONSE -> POSTTRIAL
		  1/1 1/2 2/3 459/12 12/1 crash after 9792, 1343

WAIT_FOR_RESPONSE -> POSTTRIAL
		  1/2 2/3 459/12 1/2 crash after 9792, 1343

WAIT_FOR_RESPONSE -> INTERTRIAL
Add Postrial commands WAIR_FOR_RESPONSE in test loop crash after 1396
cut these out again with if(crasher) goes 35000
1/1 1/2 2/3 459/12 1/1

with crasher = 3 did 12k before I stopped it
with carhser = 2 14k then I stopped 
crahser = 1(reopen pipe)   33k, then crash
same, but move SendTrialCount line, crashes at 4k
using SendTestCoutn, sith call t statusline removed 13k
      		     remove rest of fcn 30k wihtout crash
		     simple text, show message (crasher =2)  30k without crash
		     crasher = 3 crashes at 4k
		     crasher = 7
